# Kernighan-Lin Partitioning Algorithm #

The KLPartition program is an implementation of the Kernighan-Lin partitioning
algorithm outlined in the paper "An Efficient Heuristic Procedure for Partitioning Graphs".

The program takes in a graph in the form of an adjacency matrix with an even
number of nodes and partitions the graph into two partitions of equal size.

This program was written for an assignment in the CSC 273 Data Mining course at Hofstra University
